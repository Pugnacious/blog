Description
Throughout the years fractal art has seen great progressive strides, and because the fractal community has always had such a positive attitude of mentorship and collaboration, a lot of that progress has been documented in the form of step-by-step tutorials! Below is a collection of my favorites.

I realized as I was putting this together that it served as a sort of map for all the talented folks who have graced me with their wisdom and knowledge over the 16 years I've been on DeviantArt. So I'm adding those people below - hardly a complete list, but should mention most people. If you have a tutorial you would like added to this collection, or know of a resource or even a person that has shaped your work or contributed to the community over the years, feel free to Comment below!

A special thanks to all that have contributed to :iconprojecteducate:, especially the Fractal Art section!
