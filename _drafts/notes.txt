Can I use this image as a wallpaper or background?
Yes, you can, as long as you don't change it and it's for your personal use.

Can I use you work as a basis to build one of my own?
No. The license on it restricts it, and I spend a lot of time and energy on it and would like it to stay original.
My images are not stock images and they are not provided free for that purpose.

Can I share your work?
Sure, as long as it's in a link form.  You cannot copy the image to another site without express written permission from me.

Do your images have a licence?
Yes, they are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0.  (https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)

Can I see your parameters to see how you did something?
Sure, just ask, and I have a tutorial for a lot of it.  I would appreciate seeing what you do with it too so I can shower favorites on you.  :D
