The world of fractals is a vast place full of beauty and potential. Here are some resources originating from around the fractal community which might prove helpful, ranging from software so you can get started, to fractal tutorials & techniques. This was originally a journal/profile page feature, thanks for your patience as it's easier to format here.

Note that this covers mostly IFS flame fractals and some 3d mandelbrot/bulbs. If you are interested in orbit trap check out Ultrafractal. For mandelbrot/zooming type, come join the Discord server and hit us up for resources.

With a little practice, fractaling can become a really cool and intuitive process, and it's very, very rewarding. You can discover new things just by having fun and experimenting. Eventually the numbers become abstracted and it's just like playing with clouds or smoke, or marbleizing paint; you just happen to be using the software as a medium as opposed to paint, etc.

Save your work often! I often revisit my works-in-progress and make entirely new fractals later.

Download the latest version, accessible via the Chaotica forums. GPU/OpenCL support.

Another awesome fractal flame editor which renders your fractal as you work. Apophysis users can easily transition to Chaotica. Multiple antialiasing settings allow for crisp, pixel-dense, beautiful fractals at landmark rendering speeds. You can paste many Apophysis parameters directly into Chaotica. Chaotica does not currently support 3D, but you can still produce some 3D-like effects. Most plugins are preloaded (Chaotica 2) but you can add more if you like (see below for chaotica plugins). PC, Mac and Linux support.

<a href="https://www.pugnacious.site/chaotica/crystalize/xforms">CHAOTICA PLUGINS</a>
This is a tutorial on installing the custom transforms created by Crystalize :devcrystalize:. Installation can be accomplished using git, or using a flat file copy. User transforms are transforms written in the winter xml format and stored in the user_transforms folder.

This folder is located at %appdata%\Chaotica\user_transforms

NOTE: the %appdata% environment variable points to C:\Users\<username>\Appdata\Roaming</username>

If this folder doesn’t exist, simply create it. Further instructions in the link.

Chaotica gradient/coloring tool. Chaoshelper is an app used in tandem with Chaotica that allows you to work with gradients more effectively. Copy your Chaotica xml, paste into Chaoshelper, choose a gradient pack and gradient, edit if you wish, copy again and paste back into Chaotica. Easy!

<a href="https://bit.ly/2TzPaWc">Apophysis 3D Hack</a>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/apophysis/">Apophysis 2.09</a>

Apophysis is a great fractal flame editor. You can make fractals in Apophysis and then render them to images. Many versions have been released over the years. You can start in the latest version, but if you’re new to fractals, my humble advice is to spend a little time playing around with 2.09 first as it’s very responsive to beginners. There are base plugins, but why not have more? :D You can use the Aposhack Plugin Pack or the Beginner's Plugin Pack, both below. PC support.


<b>APOPHYSIS PLUGINS</b>
<a href="https://phoenixkeyblack.deviantart.com/art/The-Aposhack-Plugin-Pack-98807426">The Aposhack Plugin Pack</a>
<a href="https://fardareismai.deviantart.com/art/Apo-Plugins-Starter-Pack-213720621">Beginner's Plugin Pack</a>

<b>Instructions:</b>

Create a new folder named "Plugins" in your Apophysis directory. If a "Plugins" folder already exists, use that folder. You can then add individual plugins as needed from this or any other Apophysis-based plugin pack. Don't add all of the plugins/plugin packs at once, or Apophysis may not run. Apophysis can only "see" about 100 plugins at once, and the more plugins you have active, the slower Apophysis will run.

You can use 64-bit or 32-bit plugins if you have a 64-bit version of Windows.  Only use 32-bit plugins if you have a 32-bit version of Windows.

If Apophysis does not list the plugins, try going to the options and make sure the "path" or directory for the plugins is the same as your plugin folder. You may have to manually edit this to make it work.

If your Windows sees the plugin DLL files as a threat, you can create an exception in Windows Defender for the plugin directory. Windows is known to delete plugin files randomly so if one or two or several go missing, check your plugin folder against the plugins in this directory. Do NOT create an exception for all DLLs in Windows Defender because this is potentially unsafe.

(I will add some recommendations soon here on common plugins that folks add, like flux, the glynns, etc.)
