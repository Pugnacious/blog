Hi Pugs,

My current working flow for the _drafts folder:

1) Choose tutorial file
2) Create folder in _drafts *for .md file only*
3) Draft header
4) Transcribe or paste text
5) Update links to resources like original tut for credit, inspo, params, etc 
6) Update this document periodically to reflect work.
7) Upon completion of any draft, update Completed section below and inform Pugnacious that draft is ready to be rewritten into Chaotica format.
