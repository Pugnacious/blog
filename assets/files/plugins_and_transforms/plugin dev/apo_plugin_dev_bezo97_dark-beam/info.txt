All these files were originally shared by Georg Kiehne (Xyrus-02), thanks to him!

Unfortunately, he left DA and this very useful project is now "hard" to find but
it's a lot less troubleful to compile using VS instead of GCC, especially when you use C++ features
like complex numbers, or anything you need in a modern code... So enjoy.

Some of the files were modified so that the project acts as a starting point for new plugin development.
See Visual Studio's Task List to complete all TODOs before releasing the plugin.
