				Not that they actually are, but...well...it might answer some questions you have but didn't want to ask out of fear of being rude.  
				Or something.

				   <p class="terms">
				   <b>So, what's different in this version of <i>JU v.2.2</i>?</b>
				   <br>
				   Oh, not much. Just nearly twice the amount of information in the first official version, three total Julian techniques discussed and tons more graphics.
				   <b>And</b>, it now has a version number after the title.
				   <br><br>
				   If you want more info on the changes, look in the 
				   <a href="#updates" title="Updates" onMouseOver="window.status='Updates'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">Updates</a> section above.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Grand Julians seem pretty easy to make.  Why is this labeled as an intermediate guide?</b>
				   <br>
				   Julians <i>are</i> very easy to create.
				   The problem arises from the fact that Apophysis can be difficult to manipulate.
				   For s brief moment, I considered adding a section about the <i>Transform Editor</i>, <i>Options</i> window, etc. to <i>JU v.2.2</i>, but decided against it since I already had created the beginner's tutorial entitled 
				   <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/34031367" title="Apophysis Guide v.2.1" onMouseOver="window.status='Apophysis Guide v.2.1'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">The Apophysis Guide v.2.1: A Guide to Basic Flame Creation</a>.
				   I didn't see the point of further enlarging <i>JU v.2.2</i> when I already had something else out there.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What on earth possessed you to write a 55 page guide just for Grand Julians?</b>
				   <br>
				   Well, technically it's not 55 pages of actual text, but I get your point.  
				   <br><br>
				   I'm not really sure.  
				   Sometimes, I get these ideas to write something and it builds up in my brain until I have to do it.
				   It starts out as "hmm, Julians from Apophysis 2.04b aren't importing correctly into any other version".
				   A little later it's "boy, that layout is really starting to bug me."
				   I guess it's also, "whoa, when I wrote <i>Julia Uncovered</i> I thought I knew so much when in reality I knew crap about Julians!"
				   From there, I kept thinking of more useful information to include that would help Apophysis users.
				   I added the mini-glossary to help less knowledgable users with some of the basic terms, though looking back at the entries I wonder if anyone is going to understand a thing I said.
				   <br><br>
				   I guess the real answer is that I like technical writing and I like Apophysis.
				   I also like helping people and don't want others to be turned off by the more difficult aspects of the application.
				   When I first came onto the glorious i-net, I used to wonder what kind of person would take the time to write tutorials, FAQs and walkthroughs.
				   I guess that kind of person is me.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What on earth possessed you to write and code such a large HTML readme?</b>
				   <br>
				   No comment.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What's with the smart ass readme?</b>
				   <br>
				   Smart ass readmes always seemed like tons of fun to write.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Why didn't you use a CSS page for the readme?</b>
				   <br>
				   My goal was to make the simplest readme as possible.  
				   In my experience, readers are often confused by HTML files and folders, which is why I use PDF files only for tutorials.
				   There were some little details I had wanted to include, such as adding a little CJ icon to the page title, but that would have required extra graphics and possibly additional folders (and only coders like me would have noticed).
				   <br><br>
				   Typically I relied on TXT files in the past, but decided to use a more platform friendly format this time around (though most people who use Apophysis use Windows, so it's all kind of moot).
				   Anyway, I got to work on coding and create a much prettier readme while only relying on one type of document.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What's up with the horizontal rules in the readme?  They're like 25% of the main table.</b>
				   <br>
				   Technically they are a third of the table's width.
				   <br><br>
				   I had intended to use full length rules or at least different colored cells for the section titles, but I didn't like the results.
				   Instead I returned to the partial horizontal rule width.
				   Trust me.  They looked far less blocky than lots of rectangular boxes.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Why didn't you use the &lt;UL&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; tags for the bulleted lists?</b>
				   <br>
				   I'm glad you asked.  I thought I was the only one who would have noticed.
				   <br><br>
				   You see, while I designed the readme for Firefox, I realized that users would continue to use other browsers like Explorer.
				   HTML and CSS render differently in different browsers.
				   Some elements look better in one browser over another.
				   The list laid out beautifully in Explorer (for some reason), but was completely wrong in Firefox.
				   I had the same problem when developing my Apophysis website, so I took that code and applied it here.
				   Since I do not really need a list function, I felt it was fine to fudge the coding to make it appear as though I had used the &lt;UL&gt; tag.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>In the Transform Editor section of the guide you stated that you would refer to triangles as "transforms" yet your new screenshots continue to refer to them as "triangles".   
					What's up with that?</b>
					<br>
					Yes.  
					I only noticed that error when I converted the files to HTML for the online version.
					Frankly, I'm sick of the whole thing at this point (there's a heck of a lot of data to keep tabs on) and I don't think anyone will care.
					In fact, the hover text in the <i>Transform Editor</i> refers to transforms as "triangles". 
					Just for the record, the screenshots for Julian Variation 3 use the term "transforms".
				   
				   <br><br>
				   <b>May I upload/offer commercially/place on a website/show my girlfriend an image I created from your tutorial?</b>
				   <br>
				   Read the opening of <i>Julia Uncovered v.2.2</i> and/or 
				   <a href="#terms" title="Terms of Use" onMouseOver="window.status='Terms of Use'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">Terms of Use</a> section below.  But basically, <strong>YES</strong>.  Now stop asking me.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>May I upload/offer commercially/place on a website/show my girlfriend an image I created from your flame pack?</b>
				   <br>
				   Probably.  As long as the alteration to the flame is more than a simple gradient change, it should be fine.  
				   Again, read the opening of <i>Julia Uncovered v.2.2</i> and/or 
				   <a href="#terms" title="Terms of Use" onMouseOver="window.status='Terms of Use'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">Terms of Use</a> section below. 

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Is it okay if I print out <i>Julia Uncovered</i>?</b>
				   <br>
				   Of course.  That's why I created the tutorial as a handy-dandy PDF.  
				   But beware.  Fifty-five pages of graphics will do a number on your inkjet priter.  I recommend using a laserjet, if possible.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>I have an image that looks kind of like yours, but I swear! I came up with it completely on my own...do I still need to credit you?</b>
				   <br>
				   <b>NO</b>.  
				   If you say that the flame is entirely your own, I believe you.  
				   And anyway, most Apophysis flames look similar to someone else's work.
				   It's just a hazard of fractals and how they are created.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Can I take <i>JU v.2.2</i>, decompile the contents, upload it to the Internet and claim it as my own?</b>
				   <br>
				   Stop being smart.  You already know the <acronym title="That would be a no">answer</acronym>.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Would it be okay if I host <i>JU v.2.2</i> on my personal website?</b>
				   <br>
				   Absolutely.  Just do not alter the ZIP contents or charge for download.  
				   Read the <a href="#terms" title="Terms of Use" onMouseOver="window.status='Terms of Use'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">Terms of Use</a> section below for more information.

				   <br><br>	
				   <b>Is it possible to use an original Claire Jones image for fill-in-the-blank-scenario?</b>
				   <br>
				   Possibly, but you will need express permission first.
				   Send an <a href="mailto:clairejone@gmail.com?subject=Image Use Inquiry" title="e-mail Claire" onMouseOver="window.status='e-mail Claire'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">e-mail</a>.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Um, I noticed that this version is just a <i>smidge</i> larger than the other one.</b>
				   <br>
				   And your question is?  

				   <br><br>
				   <b>I sorta kinda have dial-up.  Do you hate me?</b>
				   <br>
				   No.  I hate your crappy dial-up ISP.  
				   My recommendation is to drop it and switch to cable or DSL.  
				   Or download the file at work/school.
				   <br><br>
				   On a serious note, I didn't want to have so many images because I knew the file size would increase dramatically and having been a dial-up user I didn't want to inconvenience anyone.
				   However, I strongly felt that the images were necessary for <i>JU v.2.2</i> and even kicked out a lot of graphics.
				   I tried my best to shrink the remaining images as far as possible with minimal visual loss.
				   I'm amazed that I was able to cram nearly 90 images into 5 MB, since I would have guessed the end result to be much larger.
				   Hopefully, I can get my Apophysis website up, which does have HTML versions of my tutorials available.
				   It was some kind of horrible nightmare converting the text for <i>JU v.2.2</i> into an online format.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What's with the deviantART color scheme for the readme?</b>
				   <br>
				   Well, I hate picking out color palettes and this was a ton easier.
				   You should have seen how much effort went into picking the <font color="#063d98" title="The stupid blue link color">blue link color</font>.
				   I'm also becoming bored with the black background typical of my HTML coding.
				   <br><br>
				   I did like the color schema and most people who will download <i>JU v.2.2</i> are already dA users accustomed to this look.
				   It's a win-win situation all the way around.
				   Unless green makes you vomit, then I suppose it's a lose-lose situation, though maybe it's still a win-lose situation since I like the palette and could care less if you hate it.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Did you really figure this Apophysis/Julian stuff out all on your own?</b>
				   <br>
				   Pretty much, though that doesn't mean that I haven't had a lot of pointers and helpful criticism given to me since I began working with Apophysis in mid-2005.  
				   Plus, I've read up on many different techniques on dA, the Internet and FracFan, where I've gleaned lots of little tips here and there.  
				   I try to credit everyone that I can, as you will see in <i>JU v.2.2</i>.  
				   I think the majority of us are picking it up as we go along.
				   <br><br>
				   Users L33tM0b1l3 and Michael Faber have written to me directly to clear up some issues I had with <i>Filter Radius</i>/<i>Oversample</i> and Julians, respectively.
				   Users 2B2H, o-LJ-o, tdierikx, utak3r, datagram, ideviant, nemopaice and Zueuk have helped indirectly with their tutorials, flamepacks and comments.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>What rendering settings do you typically use?</b>
				   <br>
				   I generally render Two Transform flames at 1280x1024 resolution at 4000 <i>Quality</i> and a <i>Filter Radius</i> of 0.6-0.8, <i>Oversample</i> 2.  
				   Usually, this takes me about 12-15 minutes through Apophysis on my faster system.  
				   For renders with high saturation and hotspots, I render the same settings on flam3, which takes about 50-60 minutes. 
				   <br><br>
				   Julians take longer to render in general and require more care.
				   If rendering a Julian with a Transform 1 containing another variation beside Blur, I set the quality at anywhere between 8000-15,000, <i>Filter Radius</i> 0.4-0.8 and an <i>Oversample</i> 2 for a 1280x1024 resolution.
				   This generally takes about 45-60 minutes through Apophysis.

				   <br><br>
				   <b>Wow, you put a lot of effort into your tutorials and I really appreciate it.  Is there any other way I can support you?</b>
				   <br>
				   Yes.  
				   No cost options include linking to my main deviantART page or tutorials directly on deviations that reference my techniques.  
				   Adding <i>JU v.2.1</i> to your list of Favorites is unnecessary.
				   Not that I don't appreciate the gesture, more that I think faving is better suited to pretty pictures.
				   <br><br>
				   Buying prints from my <a href="http://clairejones.deviantart.com/store/" title="deviantART Store" onMouseOver="window.status='deviantART Store'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">deviantART Store</a> would also be lovely.  
				   Or purchasing a 3-month dA gift subscription would be extremely generous.
				   A brand-new state-of-the-art desktop supercomputer would be well received, but I won't hold my breath.

	 	 		   <p class="terms">
		 		   <sub><i>The following terms supersede all previous legal notices and the default rights specified on deviantART</i></sub>
		 
		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Preamble:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   I fully believe in the free exchange of ideas and information and support concepts such as open source applications (GIMP, Apophysis) and stock art.  
		 		   There still, however, needs to exist a respect for original work.  
		 		   Basically, while freeware is great, copyrights are genuinely useful.  
		 		   I'll spare everyone my diatribe on what I believe to be the current oppressive US/international copyright law and the subsequent squelching of artistic thought for future generations.  
		 		   Despite my feelings on the matter, copyrights have a valid purpose for protecting an artist's ability to generate revenue.  
		 		   I try to credit all of my sources and I feel that others should do the same.
		 
		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Original work:</b>
         		   	   <br>
				   All original images - <i>fractal work, pencil work, dA stamp content (excluding the stamps templates), layouts, personal site designs</i> - and those referenced from other sources - <i>drawings from stock art, fanart, beaded designs from others' patterns</i> - are only to be used elsewhere on the Internet or in any other form, analog or digital, <b>with permission</b>.  
		 		   Generally, I am very lax about granting permission, but there may be times when it is not possible.
		 		   Please <a href="mailto:clairejone@gmail.com?subject=Legal Inquiry" title="e-mail Claire" onMouseOver="window.status='e-mail Claire'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true;">contact</a> me.
	     		   	   <br><br>
				   The notable exception is in regards to wallpapers.  
		 		   deviantART users may take a desktop screenshot <b>without permission</b> and place the resulting image in their gallery.  
		 		   Ideally, there would be an accompanying link to the image in the description.		 

		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Downloading & Printing:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   Downloading/printing via a laserjet or inkjet for reference/personal use <b>is allowed</b>, mostly due to the inability to prevent such actions.  
		 		   All other printing methods are prohibited.   
		 		   The files uploaded to dA and elsewhere on the Internet are not sufficient for proper printing anyway.  

		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Tutorials:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   I create tutorials to further the spread of information in the hope that the content will be useful to others.  
		 		   I <i>expect</i> people to use the information to create their own work and I encourage it.  
		 		   That's why I created the tutorials in the first place.  
		 		   I would prefer that users not make carbon copies of my work, but I also realize that beginners might feel uncomfortable with the new techniques and stick with the basics first. 
		 		   Users are encouraged to drop a line with a link to their results, but this is not mandatory.
         		   	   <br><br>
				   All information in tutorials - including images - are original, unless otherwise indicated.  
		 		   The zip files available on deviantART containing all of the original data may be placed on a user's webspace as long as the files remain untouched.  
		 		   Just send a note or e-mail with the address of the site.  
         		   	   <br><br>
				   <b>Users may create their own work from the tutorials, upload and offer images commercially anywhere on the Internet WITHOUT PERMISSION</b>.  

		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Flames & Other Resource Packs:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   All Apophysis flames available, either in flame packs or included with tutorials, are offered with few restrictions.  
		 		   The only stipulation is that the user credits the flame's source (e.g. Claire Jones) and not <i>publicly</i> offer the derivative flame individually.
		   		   <br><br>
				   <b>This means that users may modify the flames provided into a new work, upload and offer the images commercially anywhere on the Internet WITHOUT PERMISSION</b>.   
		   		   <br><br>
				   Any personal flame parameter of mine that is "lent" to certain users may be used to create new flames, which may then be uploaded to the Internet.
				   <br><br>
				   Gradient packs are to be used <b>without permission</b> or acknowledgment.  
		 		   I can never remember where I find things like GIMP brushes, fonts or gradients since I have so many and I don't expect users to either.  
		 		   Acknowledgments <i>are</i> welcome, just not required.
				   <br><br>
				   The resource packs <b>may</b> be placed on personal webspace, again, as long as the original zip contents remain unchanged.  
		 		   If the user wishes, any new derivative flames may be included with the original zip file of the flame pack as a separate .FLAME file.

		 		   <br><br>
				   <b>Other:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   <b>Flames created <i>entirely</i> by a user are that person's property, even if the flame bears resemblance to a Claire Jones fractal.  
		 		   You DO NOT NEED PERMISSION to use such flames and images either privately or commercially.</b>
		   		   <br><br>
				   As far as my understanding goes, you are not breaking any law by creating a flame that has a similar look to another person's work.
		 		   Otherwise, we fractalists be screwed.
				   
				   <br><br>
				   <b>Conclusion:</b>
		 		   <br>
				   Plagiarism, intentional or otherwise, is a fact of life on the Internet.  
		 		   There are many laws out there and it is difficult to keep track of them all.  
		 		   I understand this.  
		 		   I'm concerned with individuals who <i>intentionally</i> take and use art/resources without permission.  
		 		   The legal disclaimer is to protect myself from those individuals.
				   <br><br>
				   Just remember this when dealing with my work.  If you <i>think</i> you're infringing, you probably aren't.  
		 		   If you <i>know</i> you're breaking copyright, well...you probably are.  
		 		   Otherwise, if still in doubt, I guess send an

				Special thanks to Gill (WelshWench) for the beta on the original <i>JU</i>, =lyastri for the IFDD nomination and Myssah for the IFDD selection.
				And of course, thanks to everyone who has downloaded my Apophysis guides and resources.
				I have been particularly overwhelmed by the positive response of <i>JU</i> and it means so much to me.  
				<br><br>
				Please remember that <i>Julia Uncovered v.2.2</i> is provided as a learning tool to help spread understanding of the fractal application Apophysis.  
				The guide only provides the basic frameworks to make a Julian.  
				Have fun and do plenty of playing.
